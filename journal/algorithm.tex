\section{Queue Implementation} \label{DescriptQ}

\subsection{Overview}
Our \emph{\ordering\ tree} data structure is used to agree on a total ordering of the operations performed on the queue.
It is a static binary tree of height $\ceil{\log_2 p}$ with one leaf 
for each process. 
Each tree node  stores an array of \emph{blocks}, where each block represents a 
sequence of enqueues and a sequence of dequeues.
See Figure \ref{orderingtree} for an example.
For ease of presentation,
we use an infinite array of blocks in each node in this section.
Then, in Section \ref{reducing}, we describe how to replace the infinite array by a representation that uses bounded space.

To perform an operation on the queue, a process $P$ appends a new block containing that  
operation to the \fld{blocks} array in $P$'s leaf.
Then, $P$ attempts to propagate the operation to each node along the path from that leaf to the root of the tree.
We shall define a total order on all operations that have been propagated to the root, which 
will serve as the linearization ordering of the operations.

%\Eric{Reworded following parag after Hossein's comments of Jan 4}
To propagate operations from a node $\var{v}$'s children to $\var{v}$, $P$ performs the following
three steps.
$P$ first observes
the blocks in both of $\var{v}$'s children that are not already in $\var{v}$,
creates a new block by combining information from those blocks, and attempts to append this 
new block to $\var{v}$'s \fld{blocks} array using a \op{CAS}.
Following \cite{DBLP:conf/fsttcs/JayantiP05}, we call this three-step sequence a
\op{Refresh} on $\var{v}$. %(see Figure \ref{fig::propagstep}).
A \op{Refresh}'s \op{CAS} may fail if there is another concurrent \op{Refresh} on~$\var{v}$.
However, since a successful \op{Refresh} propagates multiple pending operations 
from $\var{v}$'s children to $\var{v}$,
we can prove that if two \op{Refresh}es by $P$ on $\var{v}$ fail,
then $P$'s operation has been propagated to $\var{v}$ by some other process, so $P$ can continue 
onwards towards the~root.

Now suppose $P$'s operation has been propagated all the way to the root.
If $P$'s operation is an enqueue, it has obtained a place in the linearization ordering and can terminate.
If $P$'s operation is a dequeue, $P$ must use information in the tree to compute the value that the
dequeue must return.  To do this, $P$ first determines which block in the root contains its dequeue
(since the dequeue may have been propagated to the root by some other process).
$P$ does this by finding the dequeue's location in each node along the path from the leaf to the root.
Then, $P$ determines whether the queue is empty when its dequeue is linearized. 
If so, it returns \nl\ and we call it a \emph{null dequeue}.
If not, $P$ computes the rank $r$ of its dequeue among all non-null dequeues in the linearization ordering.  (We say that the $r$th element in a sequence has \emph{rank} $r$ within that sequence.)
$P$ then returns the value of the $r$th enqueue in the linearization.

We must choose what to store in each block so that the following tasks can be done efficiently.
\begin{enumerate}[label={(T\arabic*)}]
\item
\label{construct}
Construct a block for node $\var{v}$ that represents the operations in consecutive blocks in $\var{v}$'s children, as required for a \op{Refresh}.
\item
\label{findinroot}
Given a dequeue in a leaf that has been propagated to the root, find that operation's position in the root's \fld{blocks} array.
\item
\label{findrank}
Given a dequeue's position in the root, decide if it is a null dequeue (i.e., if the queue is empty when it is linearized)
or determine the rank $r$ of the enqueue whose value it returns.
\item
\label{findenqueue}
Find the $r$th enqueue in the linearization ordering.
\end{enumerate}
Since these tasks depend on the linearization ordering, we describe that ordering next.

\subsection{Linearization Ordering}

Performing a double \op{Refresh} at each node along the path from the leaf to the root ensures 
a block containing the operation is appended to the root before the operation completes.
So, if an operation $op_1$ terminates before another operation $op_2$ begins, 
$op_1$ will be in an earlier block than $op_2$ in the root's blocks array.
Thus, we linearize operations according to the block they belong to in the root's array.
We can choose how to order operations within the same block, since they must be concurrent.

Each block in a leaf represents one operation.
Each block $B$ in an internal node $\var{v}$ results from merging
several consecutive blocks from each of $\var{v}$'s children.
The merged blocks in $\var{v}$'s children are called the \emph{direct subblocks} of $B$.
A block $B'$ is a \emph{subblock} of $B$ if it is a direct subblock of $B$
or a subblock of a direct subblock of $B$.
A block $B$ represents the set of operations in all of $B$'s subblocks in leaves of the tree.
The operations propagated by a \op{Refresh} are all pending when the \op{Refresh} occurs,
so there is at most one operation per process.
Hence, a block represents at most $p$ operations in total.  
Moreover, we never append empty blocks, so 
each block represents at least one operation and it follows that a block can have at most $p$ direct subblocks.

As mentioned above, we are free to order operations within a block however we like.
We order the enqueues and dequeues separately, and put the 
operations propagated from the left child before the operations from the right child.
More formally, we inductively define sequences $E(B)$ and $D(B)$ of the enqueues and dequeues
represented by a block $B$.
If $B$ is a block in a leaf representing an enqueue operation, its enqueue sequence $E(B)$ is that operation
and its dequeue sequence $D(B)$ is empty.  If $B$ is a block in a leaf representing a dequeue, $D(B)$ is that single operation and $E(B)$ is empty.
If $B$ is a block in an internal node $\var{v}$ with direct subblocks $B^L_1, \ldots, B^L_\ell$ from 
$\var{v}$'s left child
and $B^R_1,\ldots,B^R_r$ from $\var{v}$'s right child, then $B$'s operation sequences are defined by the concatenations 
\begin{eqnarray}
E(B) &=& E(B^L_1)\cdots E(B^L_\ell)\cdot E(B^R_1) \cdots E(B^R_r) \mbox{ and }\nonumber\\
D(B) &=& D(B^L_1)\cdots D(B^L_\ell)\cdot D(B^R_1) \cdots D(B^R_r).
\label{defSeqs}
\end{eqnarray}
We say the block $B$ \emph{contains} the operations in $E(B)$ and $D(B)$.

When linearizing operations within one of the root's blocks, we choose
to put the block's enqueues before its dequeues.
Thus, if the root's blocks array contains blocks $B_1, \ldots, B_k$, the 
linearization ordering~is 
\begin{equation}
L=E(B_1)\cdot D(B_1) \cdot E(B_2) \cdot D(B_2) \cdots E(B_k) \cdot D(B_k).\label{linearization}
\end{equation}

\caption{Objects used in the \ordering\ tree data structure.\label{object-fields}}
\end{figure*}

In this section, we describe how to represent blocks so that
tasks \ref{construct} to \ref{findenqueue} can be done efficiently.
Each \node\ of the \ordering\ tree has an infinite array called \fld{blocks}.
To simplify the code, \fld{blocks}[0] is initialized with an empty \block\ $B_0$, 
where $E(B_0)$ and $D(B_0)$ are empty sequences.
Each \node's \fld{head} index  stores the position in the \fld{blocks} array to be used
for the next attempt to append a \block.

If a block contained an explicit representation of its sequences of enqueues and dequeues,
it would take $\Omega(p)$ time to construct a block, which would be too slow for task \ref{construct}.
Instead, the block stores an implicit representation of the sequences.
We now explain how we designed the fields for this implicit representation. 
Refer to Figure \ref{implicit} for an example showing how the tree in Figure \ref{orderingtree} is actually represented, and Figure \ref{object-fields} for the definitions of the fields of \blocks\ and \nodes.

%The information stored in a \block\ depends on whether it is in an internal node or a leaf.
A block in a leaf represents a single enqueue or dequeue.  The block's \fld{element} field stores the value
enqueued if the operation is an enqueue, or \nl\ if the operation is a dequeue.

Each block in an internal \node\ $\var{v}$ has fields \eleft\ and \eright\ that store the indices of the block's last direct subblock in $\var{v}$'s left and right child.  
Thus, the direct subblocks of $\var{v}.\fld{blocks}[b]$ are
\begin{eqnarray}\label{defsubblock}
\var{v}.\fld{left.blocks}[\var{v}.\fld{blocks}[b-1].\fld{end\sub{left}}+1..\nonumber\\
		\var{v}.\fld{blocks}[b].\fld{end\sub{left}}] \mbox{ and}\nonumber\\
\var{v}.\fld{right.blocks}[\var{v}.\fld{blocks}[b-1].\fld{end\sub{right}}+1..\nonumber\\
		\var{v}.\fld{blocks}[b].\fld{end\sub{right}}].\hspace*{3mm}
\end{eqnarray}
The \eleft\ and \eright\ fields allow us to navigate to a block's direct subblocks.
Blocks also store some prefix sums:
%the block in 
$\var{v}.\fld{blocks}[b]$ has two fields \fld{sum\sub{enq}} and \fld{sum\sub{deq}}
that store the total numbers of enqueues and dequeues in $\var{v}.\fld{blocks}[1..\var{b}]$.
We use these to search for a particular operation.
% pinpoint the  location of an operation among the subblocks of a given block.
For example, consider finding the $r$th enqueue $E_r$ in the linearization.
A binary search for $r$ on the \fld{sum\sub{enq}} fields of the root's blocks 
finds the block  containing $E_r$.
If we know a block $B$ in a \node\ $\var{v}$ contains $E_r$,
we can use the \fld{sum\sub{enq}} field again to determine which child of $\var{v}$ contains $E_r$
and then do a binary search
of the \fld{sum\sub{enq}} fields of the direct subblocks of $B$ in that child.
Thus, we work our way down the tree until we find the leaf block that  stores 
$E_r$ explicitly.
%Now, suppose we want to find the $r$th enqueue in the linearization ordering for task \ref{findenqueue}.Let $B_1, B_2, \ldots, B_k$ be the blocks in the root.
%First, we need prefix sums of the number of enqueues in $E(B_1)\cdot E(B_2)\cdots E(B_i)$
%so that we can do a binary search for the block $B_e$ that contains the $r$th enqueue.
%This prefix sum also allows us to know the rank $r'$ within $E(B_e)$ of the $r$th enqueue.
%Once we have $r'$, we need the number of enqueues that $B_e$ received from its left child
%to determine whether the enqueue came from the left or right child of the root.
%Suppose the enqueue came from the right child $v_r$.
%Then, we know that the index of the block in $v_r$ that contains the enqueue
%is between $B_{e-1}.\eright + 1$ and $B_e$.\eright.
%We can again do a binary search within this range.
%For this, we can again use the prefix sums of the number of enqueues in any prefix of the array $v_r.blocks$.
%We can then continue in this way down the tree until reaching a leaf where the enqueue is stored explicitly.
We shall show that the binary search in the root can be done in $O(\log p + \log q)$ steps,
and the binary search within each other \node\ along the path to a leaf takes $O(\log p)$ steps,
for a total of $O(\log^2 p + \log q)$ steps for task \ref{findenqueue}.
%All information needed for this search process can be derived from the 
%\eleft, \eright\ and \fld{sum\sub{enq}} fields.

A block is called the \emph{superblock} of all of its direct subblocks.
To facilitate navigating upwards in the ordering tree for task \ref{findinroot}, each block $B$ has a field \fld{super} that contains
the (approximate) index of its superblock in the parent \node's \fld{blocks} array (it may differ from the true index by 1).
%We shall ensure that the value of $B.\fld{super}$ differs from the true index of $B$'s superblock by at most 1.
This allows a process to determine the true location of the superblock by checking the \eleft\ or \eright\ values of just two \blocks\ in the parent \node.
Thus, starting from an operation in a leaf's block, one can use these indices to track the 
operation  up the path to the root, and determine the operation's location in a root block
in $O(\log p)$ time.

Now consider task \ref{findrank}.
To determine whether the queue is empty when a dequeue occurs,
each block in the root has a \fld{size} field storing the number of elements
in the queue after all operations in the linearization up to that block (inclusive) 
have been done.
We can  determine which dequeues in a block $B_d$ in the root are null dequeues using
$B_{d-1}.\fld{size}$, which is the size of the queue just before $B_d$'s operations, and the number of enqueues and dequeues in $B_d$.
Moreover, the total number of non-null dequeues in blocks $B_1, \ldots, B_{d-1}$ 
is $B_{d-1}.\fld{sum\sub{enq}}-B_{d-1}.\fld{size}$.
We can use this information to determine the
rank of a non-null dequeue in $B_d$ among all non-null dequeues in the linearization, which is the rank  (among all enqueues) of the enqueue
whose value the dequeue should return.

Having defined the fields required for tasks \ref{findinroot}, \ref{findrank} and \ref{findenqueue},
we can easily see how to construct a new block $B$ during a \op{Refresh} in $O(1)$ time.
A \op{Refresh} on \node\ $\var{v}$ reads the values $h_{\ell}$ and~$h_{r}$ of the \fld{head} fields of $\var{v}$'s children and stores 
$h_{\ell}-1$ and $h_{r}-1$ in $B.\eleft$ and $B.\eright$.
Then, we can compute 
\begin{eqnarray*}
B.\fld{sum\sub{enq}}&=&\var{v}.\fld{left}.\fld{blocks}[B.\eleft].\fld{sum\sub{enq}} \\
&&+ \var{v}.\fld{right}.\fld{blocks}[B.\eright].\fld{sum\sub{enq}}.
\end{eqnarray*}
For a block $B$ in the root, $B.\fld{size}$ is computed using the \fld{size} field of the previous block $B'$ and
the number of enqueues and dequeues in~$B$
\rev{as follows.  Before the operations of $B$, the queue has $B'.\fld{size}$ elements.
The enqueues of $B$ add $B.\fld{sum\sub{enq}}-B'.\fld{sum\sub{enq}}$ elements.
Then the dequeues of $B$ remove $B.\fld{sum\sub{deq}} - B'.\fld{sum\sub{deq}}$ elements
(unless the size becomes 0 at some point during these dequeues).  Thus, we have}
\begin{eqnarray*}
B.\fld{size} &=& \max(0, B'.\fld{size} + (B.\fld{sum\sub{enq}}-B'.\fld{sum\sub{enq}})\\ 
			&& \hspace*{19mm}\mbox{ } - (B.\fld{sum\sub{deq}} - B'.\fld{sum\sub{deq}})).
\end{eqnarray*}

The only remaining field is $B.\fld{super}$.  When the block 
$B$ is created for a \node\ $\var{v}$, we do not yet know where its
superblock will eventually be installed in \var{v}'s parent.
So, we leave $B.\fld{super}$ blank.  
Soon after $B$ is installed,
%a call to \op{Advance} at line \ref{helpAdvance} or \ref{advance} by 
some process will
set \var{B}.\fld{super} to a value read from the \fld{head} field of \var{v}'s parent.
We shall show that this happens soon enough that $B.\fld{super}$ can differ from the true index of \rev{$B$'s superblock}
by at most 1.
%After $B$ is installed 
%in $\var{v}.\fld{blocks}[\var{h}]$, processes cooperate to fill in $B.\fld{super}$ 
%when they attempt to advance $\var{v}.\fld{head}$ from $h$ to $h+1$,
%using a value they read from the \fld{head} field of $\var{v}$'s parent.
%As mentioned above, this might not be the exact index of $B$'s superblock, but we
%shall prove that it is close.

\subsection{Details of the Implementation}

We now discuss the queue implementation in more detail.  Pseudocode is provided in Figures \ref{code1}--\ref{code3}.
%We use $v.\var{blocks[i].num\sub{enq}}$ as shorthand for 
%$v.\var{blocks[i].sum\sub{enq} - blocks[i-1].sum\sub{enq}}$, that is, 
%the number of enqueues in the block.  (For $\var{i}=0$, $v.\var{blocks[0].num\sub{enq}} = 0$.)
%We use \var{num\sub{deq}} similarly.
%\here{Check if the num abbreviation is really needed in the code--how many times do we use it?}

An \opemph{Enqueue}(\var{e}) 
\rev{creates a new Block at line \ref{enqNew} and sets its fields to indicate
that the Block represents an \op{Enqueue}.  The enqueued item \var{e} is stored in the block's \fld{element}
field.
The call to \op{Append}, described below, on line \ref{enqAppend}
appends the \block\ to the process's leaf and ensures it is propagated to the root.}

A \opemph{Dequeue} also 
\rev{creates a new Block at line \ref{deqNew} and sets its fields to indicate
that the Block represents a \op{Dequeue}.
It then calls \op{Append} at line \ref{deqAppend} to append the \block\ to the process's leaf and ensure
it is propagated to the root.
Then,} the \op{Dequeue} calls \op{IndexDequeue} to compute
its position in the root 
 and then calls \op{FindResponse} to compute its response.

\opemph{Append}(\var{B}) first adds the block \var{B} to the invoking process's leaf.
The leaf's \fld{head} field stores the first empty slot in the leaf's \fld{blocks} array,
so the \op{Append} writes \var{B} there \rev{at line \ref{appendLeaf}} and then increments \fld{head} \rev{at line \ref{appendEnd}}.
Since \op{Append} writes only to the process's own leaf, there cannot be concurrent updates to a leaf.
\op{Append} then calls \op{Propagate} \rev{at line \ref{appendProp}} to ensure the operation represented by \var{B} is propagated to the root.

\opemph{Propagate}(\var{v}) guarantees that any blocks that are in \var{v}'s children when \op{Propagate} is invoked are propagated to the root.
It uses the double \op{Refresh} idea described
above and calls  \op{Refresh} on \var{v} twice in Lines
\ref{firstRefresh} and \ref{secondRefresh}. 
If both calls fail to add a block to \var{v}, it means some other process has done a successful \op{Refresh}
that propagated blocks that were in \var{v}'s children prior to line \ref{firstRefresh} to \var{v}.
Then, \op{Propagate} recurses to \var{v}.\fld{parent} to continue propagating blocks up to the root.  

A \opemph{Refresh} on node \var{v} creates a block representing the new blocks
in \var{v}'s
children and tries to append it to \var{v}.\fld{blocks}. 
Line \ref{readHead} reads \var{v}.\fld{head} into the local variable \var{h}.
Line \ref{invokeCreateBlock} creates the new block $B$ to install in \var{v}.\fld{blocks}[\var{h}].
If line \ref{invokeCreateBlock} returns \nl\ instead of a new block, there were no new blocks in \var{v}'s children to propagate to \var{v}, so \op{Refresh} can return true at line \ref{addOP} and terminate.
Otherwise, the CAS at line \ref{cas} tries to install $B$ into \var{v}.\fld{blocks}[\var{h}].
Either this CAS succeeds or some other process has installed a  block in this location.
Either way, line \ref{advance} then calls \opemph{Advance} to advance \var{v}'s head index 
from \var{h} to $\var{h}+1$
and fill in the \fld{super} field of the most recently appended block.
The boolean value returned by \op{Refresh} indicates whether its CAS succeeded.
A \op{Refresh} may pause after a successful CAS before calling \op{Advance} at line \ref{advance},
so other processes help keep \fld{head} up to date by  calling \op{Advance}, 
either at line \ref{helpAdvance} during a \op{Refresh} on \var{v}'s parent or line \ref{advance} during a \op{Refresh} on~\var{v}.

\opemph{CreateBlock}(\var{v, i}) is used
by \op{Refresh} to construct a new block $B$ to be installed in \var{v}.\fld{blocks}[\var{i}].
The \eleft\ and \eright\ fields store the indices of the last blocks appended to \var{v}'s
children, obtained by reading the \fld{head} index in \var{v}'s children.
Since the \fld{sum\sub{enq}} field should store the number of enqueues in
\var{v}.\fld{blocks}[1..\var{i}] and these enqueues come from \var{v}.\fld{left.blocks}[1..\var{B}.\eleft] and \var{v}.\fld{blocks}[1..\var{B}.\eright], line \ref{createSumEnq} sets
\fld{sum\sub{enq}} to the sum of $\var{v}.\fld{left.blocks}[\var{B}.\eleft].\fld{sum\sub{enq}}$ and $\var{v}.\fld{right}.\fld{blocks}[\var{B}.\eright].\fld{sum\sub{enq}}$.
Line \ref{computeNumEnq} sets \var{num\sub{enq}} to the number of enqueues in the new block by
subtracting  the number of enqueues  in \var{v}.\fld{blocks}[$1..\var{i}-1$] from \var{B}.\fld{sum\sub{enq}}.
The values of \var{B}.\fld{sum\sub{deq}} and \var{num\sub{deq}} are computed similarly.
Then, if \var{B}
is going to be installed in the root, line \ref{computeLength} computes the \fld{size} field, which
represents the number of elements in the queue after the operations in the block are performed.
Finally, if the new block contains no operations, \op{CreateBlock} returns \nl\ to indicate
 there is no need to install~it.

Once a dequeue is appended to a block of the process's leaf and propagated to the root,
the \opemph{IndexDequeue} routine finds the dequeue's location in the root.
More precisely, \opa{IndexDequeue}{v, b, i}
computes the block in the root and the rank
within that block  of the \var{i}th dequeue of the block \var{B} stored in \var{v}.\fld{blocks}[\var{b}].
Lines \ref{idsup1}--\ref{idsup3} compute the location of $B$'s superblock in \var{v}'s parent, taking into account the fact that $B.\fld{super}$ may differ from the superblock's true index by one.
The arithmetic in lines \ref{computeISuperStart}--\ref{computeISuperEnd} compute the dequeue's 
rank within the superblock's sequence of dequeues, using  (\ref{defSeqs}).

%Thus, after \var{B} is installed, the call to \op{Advance} at line \ref{advance} sets the value of \var{B}.\fld{super} by reading \var{par}.\fld{head}.
%As mentioned earlier, other processes may help by calling \op{Advance} at line \ref{helpAdvance} or \ref{advance} to ensure that $\var{B}.\fld{super}$ is filled in soon after \var{B} is installed.
%We shall show {$B$.\fld{super}}  differs
%from the index of $B'$ by at most~1. 

To compute the response of the $i$th \op{Dequeue} in the $b$th block
of the root, \opemph{FindResponse}(\var{b, i}) determines at line \ref{checkEmpty} if the queue is empty.
If not, line \ref{computeE} computes the rank \var{e} of the
\op{Enqueue} whose argument is the \op{Dequeue}'s response. 
A binary search on the \fld{sum\sub{enq}} fields of \var{root}.\fld{blocks} finds the index $b_e$ of the block that contains 
the \var{e}th enqueue.
Since the enqueue is linearized before the dequeue, $b_e\leq b$.  To find the left end of the range for the binary search for $b_e$, we can first do a doubling search \cite{BY76}, comparing \var{e} to the \fld{sum\sub{enq}} fields at indices $b-1, b-2, b-4, b-8, \ldots$.
Then, \op{GetEnqueue} traces down through the tree to find the required enqueue in a leaf.

\opemph{GetEnqueue}(\var{v, b, i}) returns the argument of the
$i$th enqueue in the $b$th block $B$ of \typ{Node} $\var{v}$. 
It recursively finds the location of the enqueue in each node along the path from $v$ to a leaf, which stores the argument explicitly.
\op{GetEnqueue} first determines which child of \var{v} contains the enqueue, and
then finds the range of blocks within that child that are subblocks of $B$ using information stored
in $B$ and the block that precedes $B$ in $v$.
\op{GetEnqueue} finds the exact subblock containing the enqueue using a binary search on the \fld{sum\sub{enq}}
field (line~\ref{getChild}) and proceeds recursively down the tree.
