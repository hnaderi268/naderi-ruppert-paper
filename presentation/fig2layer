# convert some layers of fig file to tex format (will also create auxiliary .pdf files that
# are needed).  To use this programme, just type
# fig2layer mag seqnum layers file1
# mag is the magnification
# seqnum is the sequence number for the output file
# layers is the list of depths in fig2dev format; e.g +10,40,55:70 means keep only
# elements with depth 10, 40 and 55 through 70.  A leading - omits those depths.
# Don't type the .fig ending
# Generated files will be file-seqnum.tex and file-seqnum.pdf
#
# Then, in the LaTeX file, type \input{file} (don't type the .tex ending).
# needs epsfig package and may need graphicx and color packages.
